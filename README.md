# Hi, my name is Franky Campuzano. 

I'm an undergrad at Columbia University studying politics and programming.

If you want to reach out, feel free to reach out via email at fc2608@columbia.edu or through twitter [here](www.twitter.com/frankycmpz).

If you're an employer looking at this page, consider hiring me. I'm tired of being asked by my friends what my *next bot idea* is.
