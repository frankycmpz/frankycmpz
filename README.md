# Hi, my name is Franky Campuzano. 

I'm an undergrad at Columbia University studying politics and programming. 

Most of the projects on here will involve my Twitter bots. 
I decided to invest the unhealthy amount of time I spend on Twitter into something that would take advnantage my programming skills.
