# Hi, my name is Franky Campuzano. 

I'm an undergrad at Columbia University studying politics and programming. 

Most of the projects on here will involve my Twitter bots. 
I decided to invest the unhealthy amount of time I spend on Twitter into something that would take advantage of my programming skills.

If you want to reach out, feel free to reach out via email at fc2608@columbia.edu or through twitter [here](https://www.twitter.com/frankycmpz).

If you're an employer looking at this page, consider hiring me. I'm tired of being asked by my friends what my *next* bot idea is.
